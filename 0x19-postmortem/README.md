Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:
Duration: May 10, 2023, 10:00 AM (UTC) to May 11, 2023, 2:00 AM (UTC)
Impact: The online shopping service was unavailable intermittently during the incident. Users experienced slow response times and intermittent errors. Approximately 30% of users were affected.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the web stack outage was identified as a database connection leak. The application's connection pool was not properly managed, leading to a gradual depletion of available connections over time.

Timeline:
- May 10, 2023, 10:30 AM (UTC): The issue was detected when the monitoring system alerted a high rate of errors and increased response times.
- Actions taken: The operations team investigated the web servers, load balancers, and caching layers assuming a potential infrastructure problem. Database performance and connectivity were also examined.
- Misleading investigation: The team initially suspected a network issue due to intermittent errors and slow response times, leading to a focus on network components and configurations.
- May 10, 2023, 12:00 PM (UTC): As the investigation continued, it was escalated to the development team responsible for the web application.
- The incident was resolved: The development team discovered the database connection leak by analyzing application logs and examining the database connection pool implementation.
- May 11, 2023, 2:00 AM (UTC): The issue was resolved after implementing a fix to properly release and recycle database connections.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the web stack outage was identified as a database connection leak. Due to improper management of the connection pool, connections were not being released correctly after usage, leading to a gradual exhaustion of available connections. As a result, the application was unable to handle incoming requests, causing slow response times and intermittent errors.

To address the issue, the development team modified the connection pool implementation. They implemented a fix that ensured connections were properly released and recycled after each request, preventing the accumulation of leaked connections. This fix effectively resolved the database connection leak and restored normal operation of the web stack.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:
- Implement automated monitoring and alerting for database connection pool utilization and health.
- Regularly review and optimize the connection pool configuration to ensure efficient resource usage.
- Conduct thorough testing and quality assurance on connection management during application development and deployment.
- Enhance logging and error tracking to quickly identify and investigate abnormal application behavior.
- Provide proper training and knowledge sharing to improve awareness of connection management best practices among the development team.

Tasks to address the issue:
- Patch the application with the updated connection pool implementation.
- Enhance monitoring by integrating database connection pool metrics into the existing monitoring system.
- Conduct a code review to ensure proper connection handling throughout the application codebase.
- Update the incident response playbook to include scenarios related to connection leaks and slow response times.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, the team aims to proactively mitigate the risk of future web stack outages caused by database connection leaks and ensure a more robust and reliable online shopping service.

This postmortem provides a comprehensive analysis of the web stack outage incident, outlining the impact, root cause, timeline of events, resolution, and measures to prevent future occurrences.
